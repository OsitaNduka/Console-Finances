# Console-Finances
 
 ## Description
 This is a finacial analysis using JavaScript. I used javascript to write code that analyses these records to calculate each of the following:
 (1) The Total number of months included in the dataset.
 (2) The net total amount of profit/losses over the entire period.
 (3) The average of the changes in profit /losses over the entire period. Tracking what the total change in profits from month to month and then find the average (Total/Number of Months).
 (4)The greatest increase in profits (date and month)over the entire period.
 (5) The greatest decrease in losses (date and month) over the entire period.

 ## Usage

 When you open the browser and inspect the console it will show the result of the code.
